Participating users can choose to join any family and engage in activities collectively. Additional rewards are distributed based on the final accumulated points ranking of the family.

#### Invite Quest

The invitation task involves inviting your friends to join us on our journey.To complete this task, simply use your unique invitation link (available on the invitation task page) to invite your friends to complete the basic tasks.

Users can earn Points rewards by inviting new users to join Optopia and participate in the Gas Fee Airdrop program. Inviters can receive an additional reward equivalent to 10% of the total Points accumulated by the invitees. Finally, additional rewards will be distributed based on the total accumulated points earned by everyone.

## Wisdom Vault

## **Crystal Sands Quarry**

The subterranean maze of the Crystal Sands Quarry conceals numerous potential ore veins, making it the perfect place to embark on your mining journey. Currently, "Go mining x-points" has been officially launched, allowing you to earn X-Points on the Optopia Mainnet by initiating transactions and consuming Gas.

In just a few seconds, you can determine the amount of X-Points you can earn. Currently, for every 0.000015 ETH consumed, you earn 75 X-POINTS. Note: You can also earn X-Points rewards by generating gas consumption through interactions with Optopia ecosystem applications or by making transfers within Optopia.

#### Gas Refund

To enhance community engagement on the mainnet, Optopia has launched a Gas Refund campaign where users receive automatic refunds for gas consumed within each round. This means users can interact on the Optopia mainnet at zero cost.

Currently, the Gas will be refunded every 48 hours approximately (based on block numbers). Here, users can monitor real-time cumulative gas consumption within each round. All gas consumed during one round will be automatically refunded to the user's address after the round concludes.

By consistently consuming gas, users can earn additional X-Points, increasing their chances of participating in future airdrops.

## What is X-Points?

X-Points are special points provided by Optopia to incentivize residents who deeply engage in building Optopia. They also serve as important proof for future airdrop rewards.

## What is Refundable Gas?

In the Refundable Gas module, any gas consumed within the specified block range will be recorded under Refundable Gas. Once the end block is reached, the accumulated gas will be refunded collectively. Simultaneously, X-Points will be accumulated based on the gas consumption during this period.
