# About Optopia

The concept of utopia, as envisioned by Thomas More in "Utopia", published in 1516, paints a picture of an ideal society free from wealth disparity, social conflict, and injustice, where individuals enjoy freedom, equality, and happiness.&#x20;

In this society, social wealth does not belong to individuals but to the entire community. The government is guided by the principles of fairness and social justice, implementing selfless and ideal governance.

Every citizen abides by the same rules and contributes equally to society.
