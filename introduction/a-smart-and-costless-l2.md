# A Smart and Costless L2

Optopia marks the inception of the first L2 solution utilizing Arweave as the Data Availability (DA), establishing the **most** **cost-effective** L2 solution in the industry. This groundbreaking technology not only represents a significant advancement in the blockchain realm but also introduces a fresh user experience.

## **How Optopia works**

Optopia is an EEVM Compatible Rollup that integrates OP Stack. This integration aims to enhance baseline revenues for users and developers without altering the overall cryptocurrency user experience. Additionally, by incorporating Arweave for DA, Optopia significantly reduces transaction costs, setting a new standard for cost-effectiveness in the L2 space.

**OP Stack serves as a standardized, shared, and open-source development stack.** It acts as a software component that defines specific layers within the Optopia ecosystem while also functioning as a module in the existing layers.

**Arweave functions as a blockchain infrastructure designed to address the permanence and accessibility of data.** Its "permanent file storage" technology, distinct from traditional blockchain data storage methods, ensures the permanent preservation of data.

Optopia harnesses Arweave's permanent data availability (DA) to achieve data scalability, substantially reducing gas costs associated with dApp interactions within the Optopia ecosystem.

* Compared to Ethereum: Arweave's usage cost is more affordable than Ethereum's existing cost, and it is not linearly related to Ethereum's price. Even with Ethereum's plans to reduce gas costs through EIP-4844, Arweave's costs remain notably lower.
* Compared to third-party DA providers: Arweave focuses more on data permanence and accessibility, allowing the permanent storage of data on the blockchain. This entails a one-time fee for permanent data storage and access on the blockchain, significantly reducing long-term data maintenance expenses.

With the launch of Optopia, a technological breakthrough has been achieved, creating a more convenient and cost-effective blockchain environment for users and developers alike.
