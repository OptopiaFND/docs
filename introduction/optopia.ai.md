**Optopia.ai**, in comparison to other Ethereum Layer 2 networks, places a stronger emphasis on **innovating AI standards** and **exploring AI application scenarios**. Optopia is an **L2 Blockchain** specifically designed for **artificial intelligence (AI) applications**. It is committed to pioneering AI application standards and exploring various AI use cases. Built on the **Op Stack**, Optopia ensures **100% EVM compatibility** while providing exceptional performance, minimal costs, and robust security for AI applications. Its mission is to drive the advancement and practical adoption of AI technology.

At the core of Optopia.ai lies the goal of **facilitating the implementation and promotion of AI applications**. It guides developers to innovate and explore the boundless possibilities of AI models across a wide range of real-world applications, including but not limited to **gaming, data analysis, natural language processing, computer vision, healthcare, and financial technology**.

Optopia.ai envisions creating a **decentralized network** where **anyone can freely participate in building AI-related applications**. By doing so, it aims to propel innovation in the field of AI, expand the scope of AI application scenarios, and enhance the efficiency of AI application deployment.

## Features

**Optopia** employs a **Fair Launch** mechanism, devoid of team reservations, investor allocations, or pre-mining plans, ensuring transparent and equitable token distribution. Our goal is to evolve into a community-driven Op-Rollup platform characterized by fairness and innovation, with the aim of establishing a transparent and equitable artificial intelligence domain for users.

* **Fairness**: Optopia advocates for fair issuance, with **80%** of OPAI tokens being airdropped to the community after mainnet launch, avoiding any pre-allocation to investors. Each valuable OPAI token will be distributed to all Optopia users through genuine airdrops, mining, and ecosystem funds.
* **Empowering AI**: Optopia is Ethereum’s first L2 platform custom-tailored for artificial intelligence applications. The remaining **20%** of OPAI tokens will be allocated to the ecosystem fund, specifically to incentivize future ecosystem projects and encourage their equitable development.
* **Transparency**: Optopia ensures genuine governance, with management fully adhering to community decisions. The Optopia team will step back from project management, ensuring that the community’s voice shapes its future.
* **Efficiency**: Optopia integrates the Op stack, transitioning transaction processing from Ethereum to L2. This promotes efficient transaction handling while significantly reducing gas costs.
* **Infrastructure**: Optopia provides a developer-friendly environment, equipped with robust AI application product infrastructure and incentive mechanisms, enabling developers to explore the vast potential of AI applications.
